Here are the links to all the courses/videos/blogs/articles:


1) Coursera course which I think is paid right now but was free in 2020, which was when I first used it so it has been saved to my account and I was able to go through
it again.


2) CodeWithHarry Python playlist which I used to quickly go through concepts I had forgotten.
