It was incredibly fascinating to explore these different branches of cs in the past 10 days. I spent the first 3 days reading about every vertical and deciding which one 
I wanted to choose. I was very sick and we had about 6 tut tests last week so there's that too. I ended up choosing competitive coding as my vertical. I spent the
next few days revising Python as it is the programming language I am most familiar with.

I started off by going through this course on coursera for revision purposes- https://in.coursera.org/learn/python?utm_source=mobile&utm_source=link&utm_medium=page_share&utm_content=lih&utm_campaign=card_button
This course was free in 2020 and it was what I had used to learn the basics of python in 2020 so I still have it for free (I think it's paid rn).

I also went through the python playlist on YouTube by CodeWithHarry, which has about 120 short videos. This was just to revise python because it had been
quite a while since I had programmed with Python. 

Then I made a hackerrank account and solved very few questions, before realising that ACM had instructed us to solve questions on codeforces. So I moved to 
codeforces and solved over 10 questions of different levels of difficulty (some took 30 minutes to finish, some took several hours).

I'm really interested in Artificial Intelligence as well but I really did not have the time to explore it because of the fact that we had just 10 days which included
our first set of tut tests for every subject. Having a fever did not help either. But I am glad I was able to learn what I learnt and I hope to get into ACM and learn 
even more.
